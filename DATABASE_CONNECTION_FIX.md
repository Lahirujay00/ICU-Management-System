# Database Connection Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem
The ICU Management System deployed on Vercel was not connecting to the database on the first request, requiring manual access to the `/reconnect` endpoint to establish the connection.

## Root Cause
In serverless environments like Vercel:
1. Each request may spawn a new function instance (cold start)
2. Database connections are not persistent between requests
3. The original code didn't ensure database connectivity before processing requests

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Connection Caching (`src/config/database.js`)
- Implemented connection caching using `global.mongoose` to reuse connections across function instances
- Optimized connection settings for serverless environments:
  - `maxPoolSize: 1` (single connection for serverless)
  - `bufferCommands: false` (disable mongoose buffering)
  - Increased timeouts for cold starts

### 2. Database Middleware (`src/middleware/database.js`)
- `ensureDbConnection`: Ensures database is connected before processing API requests
- Automatically attempts connection if not connected
- Returns proper error responses if connection fails
- Includes timeout handling (15 seconds)

### 3. Updated App Configuration (`src/app.js`)
- Added database middleware to all API routes
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added `/init` endpoint for pre-warming connections
- Enhanced `/reconnect` endpoint with better cache clearing

### 4. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Increased function timeout to 30 seconds
- Added maxLambdaSize configuration

## New Endpoints

### `/init`
Pre-warms the database connection. Useful for:
- Cold start optimization
- Health checks
- CI/CD pipelines

### `/health`
Enhanced health check that shows database status without requiring connection

### `/reconnect`
Improved reconnection endpoint that properly clears cache

## Usage

### For Users
The application should now connect to the database automatically on first request. No manual intervention required.

### For Developers

#### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Pre-warm Connection (Optional)
```bash
# Visit the init endpoint
curl https://icu-management-system.vercel.app/init

# Or run the init script
node init.js
```

#### Force Reconnection (If Needed)
```bash
curl https://icu-management-system.vercel.app/reconnect
```

## How It Works

1. **Cold Start**: When a new function instance starts, `connectDB()` is called
2. **Connection Caching**: The connection is cached in `global.mongoose`
3. **Request Processing**: The `ensureDbConnection` middleware checks if database is connected
4. **Auto-Reconnection**: If not connected, it automatically attempts to connect
5. **Error Handling**: If connection fails, proper error responses are returned

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ No more manual `/reconnect` visits required
- ‚úÖ Automatic database connection on cold starts
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling and user experience
- ‚úÖ Better performance with connection caching
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation if database is unavailable

## Monitoring

Check the application logs in Vercel dashboard for:
- `‚úÖ MongoDB Connected` - Successful connections
- `üîÑ Database not connected, attempting to connect` - Auto-reconnection attempts
- `‚ùå Database connection failed` - Connection errors

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Vercel:
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"
- `JWT_SECRET` - For authentication
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - Frontend URL
